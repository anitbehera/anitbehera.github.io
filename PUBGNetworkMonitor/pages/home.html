      I've reached out to PUBG developers about the loading smoke screen issue through both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/1mhdifz/smoke_screen_loading_issue_after_long_match_ends/" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a> and official PUBG support forums(Ticket #19499453). However, since there's no communication for an official fix, I took matters into my own hands.
    </p>

    <p class="fs-5">I've developed an application that resolves the loading smoke screen problem. You can see how it works in the <a href="https://youtu.be/PwGdjiFuaWY" target="_blank">demo video</a> provided.</p>

    <hr class="col-1 my-4">

    <p class="fs-5"><span class="badge bg-secondary">How it works ?</span></p>
    <p>The app automatically detects and closes inactive connections to PUBG lobby servers, which eliminates the smoke screen loading issue.</p>

    <h1>How to use?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="badge bg-secondary">Installation:</span> Download the <span class="fst-italic">PUBGNetworkMonitor.zip</span> file from above link and extract it. Run 'PUBGNetworkMonitor'.</li>
      <li><span class="badge bg-secondary">Keep Running:</span> Leave the application active throughout your PUBG gaming session (you can minimize it to run in the background).</li>
      <li><span class="badge bg-success">Fix Smoke Screen:</span> Before clicking <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">Exit to Lobby</span> in PUBG, press the <span class="badge bg-success">Network Gear</span> button located in the bottom-left corner of PUBG.</li>
      <li><span class="badge bg-secondary">Timing Note:</span> While you can use the Network Gear button at any time during the loading smoke screen, it's best to use it just before Exiting to Lobby since the effect takes 3-4 seconds to process.</li>
